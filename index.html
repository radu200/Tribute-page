                <p>Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British singer-songwriter and record producer, best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. </p>
                <p>He explored the science of human nature, arguing that ideas are governed by sensory impressions, writing "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.”</p>
                <p>Mercury was born of Parsi descent in Zanzibar, and grew up there and in India before moving with his family to Middlesex, England, in his late teens.</p>
                <p> He formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Killer Queen", "Somebody to Love", "Don't Stop Me Now", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", and "We Are the Champions".</p>
                <p>He also led a solo career while performing with Queen, and occasionally served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS, having confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease.</p>
